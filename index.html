            <strong>Origins</strong><br><br>
            In the late 1940s, the concept of cellular automata was devised by John Von Neumann as a model for self-reproducing organisms.
            Using this concept, in October 1970, mathematician John Horton Conway developed his Game of Life (or Life for short),
            which debuted as a section in Martin Gardner’s column of Scientific American.
            The Game of Life is able to display special patterns and behaviors,
            including classifiable patterns such as “gliders”, “oscillators”, “still-life”,
            and “spaceships”, which arise from just simple rules that Conway implemented in Life,
            making the game capable of forming complex scenarios that can arise from a simple initial configuration.
            This potential for randomness, I believe, can be a perfect base for a warfare simulation,
            in which cells would take over “unoccupied territory”,
            form crucial supply lines for their “frontlines” and form skirmishes along the frontlines.

            I have documented the design of cellular automata that are able to display interesting behavior
            that simulates warfare. This paper will outline the prerequisites
            (i.e. the special conditions needed to simulate warfare),
            as well as document the state set and transition function I devised for
            the cellular automata, and the interesting behavior that arose from my tests.
