            <strong>History</strong><br><br>
            In simulating a war-like environment, I had to find inspiration through that of a real life event.
            To do this, I used the example of the Eastern Front's Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's incursion into
            the Soviet Union. It was an extreme effort by Germany to take out the Soviet Union and win the war.
            The German army and the Soviet Union clashed along the frontlines, desperately trying to gain an advantage.
            Though I tried to simulate an army's advance and subsequently, the enemy's retreat. Unfortunately, 
            due to a lack of strength bias I wasn't able to simulate this in time, as a result of a lack of strength
            points / biases.

            Operation Barbarossa started on the Eastern Front in June 1941, bringing swathes of Soviet land into German control until August 1941. 
            In Fig. 3.1., on the right section, German territories are represented on the left of the spiked line, and Soviet territories are represented on the right. 
            Not only that, Fig. 3.1., presents the frontline as the black line with spikes between the two colors. This is where the two “factions” will confront each other. 
            In my simulation, behind the frontline are supplies, which will nourish the frontline and prevent it from collapsing. 
            Not only that, between two factions, there needs to be a source for which an invading army comes from. 
            In the case of Fig. 3.1., the 3 army groups North, South and Center are deployed from various territories, such as Lithuania, East Poland, and Romania. 
            These locations will be called the “capitals” in my simulation, which provides a starting point for the armies.

        <strong>States of the Automata</strong><br>
        In creating cellular automata for our simulation, I had to define a set of states and the transition function.
        The simulation must also be able to distinguish between different factions. 
        These are the states I proposed for cells, as derived from the example of the Eastern Front:
        <!-- <div id="listing"> -->
            &emsp;&emsp;Terrain: This state is fixed under every circumstance, representing the geometry of the war which will not change throughout the course of the simulation. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Unoccupied: This state represents any territory that hasn’t been occupied, or has been cut-off. This state is the default for cells. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Capital: This is the initial state for any cell designated to generate and expand an invading force. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Supply: This state is set for cells which are bridges between capital cells and frontline cells. Supply cells would be generated from frontline cells that are already behind the frontline, simulating a “reinforcement” of the frontline. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Frontline: This is the state that will be assigned for outermost cells of the “advancing force.” <br>
