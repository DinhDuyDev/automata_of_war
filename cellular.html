            Cellular automata are an array of cells, each being in one state out of many possible ones.
            Every cell in the array evolves along a discrete timeline of "generations." For each generation,
            what's called a "transition function" decides the cell's next state. The transition function does
            this by determining the number of neighbors of each cell it affects. It also takes into account
            the state of those neighbors.
            <br>
            Perhaps the most notable example of cellular automata is the Game of Life.
