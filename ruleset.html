        <strong>States of the Automata</strong><br>
        In creating cellular automata for our simulation, I had to define a set of states and the transition function.
        The simulation must also be able to distinguish between different factions. 
        These are the states I proposed for cells, as derived from the example of the Eastern Front:

        <table>
            <thead>
                <th>State name</th>
                <th>State properties</th>
                <th>Representation in simulation</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Terrain</td>
                    <td> This state is fixed under every circumstance, representing the geometry of the war which will not change throughout the course of the simulation. </td>
                    <td><img src="cell_t.png" alt="Terrain cells">
                        <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4.1.</strong> Terrain cells denoted by gray squares</figcaption>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Unoccupied</td>
                    <td>This state represents any territory that hasn't been occupied, or has been cut-off. This state is the default for cells. </td>
                    <td><img src="cell_u.png" alt="Unoccupied cells">
                    <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4.2.</strong> Empty cells denoting unoccupied cells</figcaption>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Capital</td>
                    <td>This is the initial state for any cell designated to generate and expand an invading force. </td>
                    <td><img src="cell_c.png" alt="Capital cells">
                    <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4.3.</strong> Terrain cells denoted by gray squares</figcaption>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Supply</td>
                    <td>Supply: This state is set for cells which are bridges between capital cells and frontline cells. 
                        Supply cells would be generated from frontline cells that are already behind the frontline, simulating a “reinforcement” of the frontline. </td>
                    <td><img src="cell_xs.png" alt="X Supply cells">
                        <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4.4a.</strong> X supply cells denoted by red</figcaption>
                        <img src="cell_os.png" alt="O Supply cells">
                        <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4.4b.</strong> O supply cells denoted by red</figcaption>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Frontline</td>
                    <td>This is the state that will be assigned for outermost cells of the “advancing force.” </td>
                    <td><img src="cell_f.png" alt="Frontline cells">
                    <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4.5.</strong> Frontline cells (X and O) denoted by yellow.</figcaption>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <strong>Transition Function</strong><br>
        From here, I will define some simple transition function to give the growing cluster of cells the semblance of an army expanding its territory:     
        <table>
            <thead>
                <th>Cell target</th>
                <th>Function</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Capital</td>
                    <td> If one or more neighbors is a frontline cell, and those neighbors are of the opposite faction, 
                        then the cell becomes unoccupied and factionless. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Unoccupied</td>
                    <td> if two or more neighbors is a capital cell, then the cell becomes a frontline cell. 
                        This also happens if one or more neighbors is a frontline cell. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Supply</td>
                    <td> if more than one neighbor is a frontline cell, and that neighboring cell is an enemy, then the cell becomes unoccupied and factionless. 
                        This also happens if there is one or less neighboring supply cell. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Frontline</td>
                    <td> if more than 3 neighbors are frontline cells, and there are no enemy cells, then the cell becomes a supply cell. 
                        If there is no neighboring supply cell, then the cell becomes unoccupied and factionless. </td>
                </tr>
