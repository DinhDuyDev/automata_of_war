        <strong>Interesting Behaviors</strong>
        <br>
        There are some interesting behaviors that happened due to the transition function I devised for each state and for each situation.
        These behaviors weren't planned, but they made some semblance of sense and were interesting and difficult to construct. 
        <table>
            <thead>
                <th>Behavior Name</th>
                <th>Behavior Description</th>
                <th>Representation in simulation</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Scout Cells</td>
                    <td> Due to the strange transition function related to the synthesis of frontline cells, there is a gap betweeen cells. 
                        As a result of this "weak" frontline, I came up with the term "scout cells" due to the fact that they are separated 
                        from the rest of the armies, and are unwilling to cooperate to actually form soemthing that looks strong.
                    </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>No Man's Land Cells</td>
                    <td> These cells are cells that are "factionless" - that is, they do not have an X or an O on them. They are caused by an equal number of X's and O's,
                        simulating a war in which both sides are evenly matched, leading to a No Man's Land situation where no army can cross.
                    </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Points of Skirmish</td>
                    <td> These are not cells, they're rather an interesting loop that repeats indefinitely. When there are too many neighboring 
                        enemy frontier cells, the frontier cells of one side die off. However, the supply cells revive the frontier cells. This 
                        sudden revival causes the enemy frontier cells to die off, but their supply cells revive them. This creates a loop in which nobody wins,
                        leading to a skirmish point. A skirmish point can be in one spot or along the entire borderline. One spot would be just a skirmish point, along the border
                        would be a war.

        <strong>Interesting Scenarios</strong>
        <br>
        Combined with the interesting behaviors above, the automata was able to create a bunch of interesting scenarios that can be categorized.
        <table>
            <thead>
                <th>Scenario Name</th>
                <th>Scenario Description</th>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Panicked Mobilization</td>
                    <td> Due to X's failure in allocating resources in time, a majority of X's cells run off to become factionless. 
                        O's cells convert the factionless cells and form a supply cluster on X's side, leading to them 
                        forming an actual front against them. X fails to protect themselves from O due to their weaker
                        scout cells not being a match against the stronger O front. They lose a majority of their territory and capital cells.
                    </td>
